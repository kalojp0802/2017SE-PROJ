# Demonstration

An online game created by 彭浩伦(Alan Peng), 高仓靖博(Yasuhiro Takakura) and 王雨乐(Yule Wang) in 2017 summer

This project was an HTML5 online 2D battle game. Players can fight each other or
AI enemy by answering the middle school level quiz. The database of the quiz was
created and refreshed by the web crawler. The communications between players
were implemented by UDP. Because it was based on HTML5, smartphone users
can also have fun with it.
